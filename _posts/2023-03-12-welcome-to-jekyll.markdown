# Welcome to Jekyll!

Congratulations on creating a new Jekyll site! This default page is here to give you some pointers on how to get started.

### Getting Started

To start building your site, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Add some Markdown files to your site.
2. Configure your site in `_config.yml`.
3. Preview your site locally by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
4. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub to deploy your site.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Jekyll site comes with a default theme called Minima. You can customize the theme in many ways, including adding custom styles, templates, and includes.
